# Initialize a HMM definition for each monophone based on the prototype
# HMM definition, settings parameters using iterative scheme (HTKBook 8.2)
#
# Needs to be run from where the files listed in train.scp are relative to
#
# HInit parameters:
#  -A         Print out command line options
#  -T 1	     Tracing
#  -l         Cut out segments with this label
#  -o         Use this as the output name of the hmm (instead of prototype name)
#  -M         Store output HMM files in this directory
#  -S         List of all the feature vector files
#  -I	     The MLF containing the labels for all the feature files
